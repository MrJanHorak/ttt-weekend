# Tic-Tac-Toe lab and beyond

## The age old game of Tic Tac Toe

This was one of the first labs we had to do in our JavaScript course. Create the game Tic Tac Toe over a weekend. After we finished the lab and were moving on, I couldn't rest until I sat down and figured out how to write some logic to create a computer player. As the class continued, I didn't have time to focus on this until now. Just days after the class is completed, I decided to give it a try again. 

In this variation, I create a computer player by trying to emulate my own though process while playing the game. The computer looks and the playing field. Then based upon the status of the field it runs though conditional statements. For the first move I have tried to emulate a random feel by shuffling the 'winningCombos' array and then shuffling the order it would place its first 'O'. 

Currently there is only one bug I am still working on. There are rare moments when the state of the board and the written conditional statements don't offer the computer player a choice and the human player needs to place the 'O' for the computer. I am working on this bug now. 

Default game play is set to be against the computer, you can also choose to play against another human (or just against yourself if you must.)
